1) 3
2) 150
3) 150
4) \[50,100,150\]
5) Error: i wouldn't be defined at line 12. i is defined in the for loop which is not in the same block as line 12.
6) Error: also not defined for similar reasoning as 5
7) 150
8) \[50,100,150\]
9) Error: same as 5, i would not be defined here
10) 3

E. student.courseLoad[0]

## Basic Operators & Type Conversion

13) 
A. '32', number is turned into a string so these two combine
B. 1, '-' only works with its so the string is type converted
C. 3, null gets type converted to its int value of 0
D. '3null', null gets turned into a string and they are concatenated
E. 4, true has an int value of 1
F. 3, false has value of 0
G. '3undefined', undefined gets turned into a string and concatenated
H. NaN, these are coerced into a number which would then be undefined

14) 
A. true, numeric comparison
B. false, compared by alphabetical order
C. true, loose equality so its true
D. false, false because strict equality checks type too
E. false, true has int value of 1
F. true, any nonzero int has a truth value so Boolean(2) = true

15) "==" compares the values of two data types while "===" compares both the value and the data type.
